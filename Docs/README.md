- ### Crosshair Navigation:
  Automatically synchronize slice navigation across all planes.
- ### Cine Mode:
  Play slices as an animated sequence.
- ### Mouse Interaction:
  Interact with the images directly using the mouse.
- ### AI Organ Detection
- The system integrates an AI-based model for automatic organ detection and classification within medical scans.
- Built using TensorFlow/Keras with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Automatically identifies the primary organ or region in the scan (e.g., heart, brain, liver) with confidence scores.
